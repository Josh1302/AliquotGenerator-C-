# AliquotGenerator-C++
This program computes the sum of all the proper divisors  of a positive integer.
It will also determine whether two positive integers are amicable and generate a
special sequence related to the sum of the proper divisors
Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.
